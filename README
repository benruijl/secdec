Development
-----------

The ``Makefile`` in the package's
root directory implements common development tasks.
You can list all available targets with the command

    $ make help

`pySecDec` comes with a self test suite written in the `python unittest` framework.
The most convenient way to run all test is using `nose` (http://nose.readthedocs.org).
If `nose` is installed, type

    $ make check

in the source repository to run all tests. Developers should write test cases for
ALL functions they implement and make sure that ALL tests pass before uploading a
commit.

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation of `pySecDec`, you need `sphinx` (http://www.sphinx-doc.org).
If `sphinx` is installed, the command

    $ make doc

generates the documentaion in `html` and in `pdf` format. Developers should inline-document
python functions and also keep the c++ part up to date.

Building the documentaion in pdf format requires an up-to-date installation of a latex
implementation. If you get an error about missing ".sty" file, do the following:

 1. If you are an administrator on your computer, try to install the missing latex packages
    with your favorite package manager. The MiKTeX or TeXLive implementations should contain
    all required packages.

 2. If you are not an administrator, first get the missing packages, e.g. from
    "http://www.ctan.org/". Collect the missing files in one or more directories
    and set the environment variable TEXINPUTS to these directories in the same
    way as the PATH variable is typically set.

Making a tarball
----------------

A distributable tarball can be created by the command

    $ make dist

When publishing a new release, make sure that you increase the Version number of `pySecDec`
and/or `SecDecUtil`.

"make dist" first runs "make clean" to make sure that no temporary or outdated files go into
the distribution. Then it runs builds the source distribution of the python package as with
"python setup.py sdist", the documentation as with "make doc", and it runs "make dist" in the
"util" package. Note that the "util" is an autotools package and you must have the GNU autotools
installed on your system.
